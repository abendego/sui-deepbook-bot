/**
 * BigVector is an arbitrary sized vector-like data structure, implemented using an
 * on-chain B+ Tree to support almost constant time (log base max_fan_out) random
 * access, insertion and removal.
 *
 * Iteration is supported by exposing access to leaf nodes (slices). Finding the
 * initial slice can be done in almost constant time, and subsequently finding the
 * previous or next slice can also be done in constant time.
 *
 * Nodes in the B+ Tree are stored as individual dynamic fields hanging off the
 * `BigVector`.
 *
 * Note: The index type is `u128`, but the length is stored as `u64` because the
 * expectation is that indices are sparsely distributed.
